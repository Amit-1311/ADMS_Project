## Project Description

In this project, we are tasked with building a Course Management System for a university. The system's primary purpose is to efficiently manage various aspects of university operations, including student enrollment, course assignments, faculty responsibilities, and financial transactions. It is designed to handle complex interactions and relationships between these components, ensuring the smooth functioning of the academic institution.

## Database Structure

The database structure is central to this project and includes the following key entities:

1. **Students:** Students are uniquely identified by an "S_info" and have personal details, including name, username, password, and email. They are assigned to classes and enrolled in courses based on their academic department.

2. **Courses:** Courses are identified by "Course_info" and have associated details like schedule ("Course_time"), class section ("SECTION"), credit requirements, and fees ("DetailsCourse").

3. **Faculty:** Faculty members are responsible for teaching courses, managing student assignments, and handling various academic tasks. They are identified by a unique "Faculty_id" and have a username, password, and email for system access. Faculty members are assigned to specific courses and oversee groups of students.

4. **Classes:** Classes represent physical spaces where courses are conducted. Each class is identified by "Class_info" and has a room number and section information.

5. **Academic Departments:** Academic departments are responsible for managing specific sets of courses and students. Each department is identified by a "Department_id" and is associated with faculty, courses, and students.

6. **Financial Transactions:** Financial transactions are recorded in the "Transaction" section and are uniquely identified by "S_transaction." They are related to students' payments and due amounts. Accountants manage the financial records of students and are identified by "Accountant_id."

7. **Student Details:** This table contains detailed information about students, including their assigned courses, credit requirements, and course-related details. Each student is identified by a unique "Students_id" and has links to courses, classes, and academic departments.

8. **Course Details:** This table contains additional information about courses, such as the assigned faculty, class information, and more. Each course is identified by "Course_id" and is linked to its related faculty, class, and course details.

## Functional Components

The Course Management System includes various functional components for managing students, courses, faculty, classes, academic departments, and financial transactions. These components interact seamlessly to streamline university operations, ensuring efficient academic management.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need:

- A relational database management system (RDBMS) such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Oracle Database.
- A development environment that supports SQL scripting, such as SQL clients or integrated development environments (IDEs).

## Usage

The Course Management System can be used to manage student enrollment, course assignments, faculty responsibilities, and financial transactions within a university. It offers a comprehensive solution for academic institutions seeking to streamline their operations and enhance data management.
